        <ul>
            <li>The Bulldog was trained and bred to fight bulls for sport, beginning in England in the 1200s and throughout Europe until the mid 1800s </li>
            <li>Both the Bulldog and the Mastiff have a common ancestor: The Alaunt</li>
            <li>Bull-Baiting was performed by bulldogs to tenderize the beef, butchers who sold non-baited beef were subject to penalty as the beef was improper for consumption</li>
        </ul>
